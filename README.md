# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my humble github Repository

Here you can find some projects I've made, like my personal website 
and some fun Java graphics experiments.

Hidden inside some private repos are some old uni projects which I 
can't show publicly for plagiarism related reasons, but if you're 
interested, I'm happy to share some of them if you promise not 
to steal it to pass your own degree :)
